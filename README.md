## Hey, zup? I'm Rogerio / a.k.a [rnasc][website]

### Who am I?
- Father, husband, son and developer. 
- Started learning about computers in 1987 with BASIC (yep, without 'visual')
- Professionally working with IT since 1991, over 30 years ago (can't believe it has been that long)
- Although I develop in some languages, in 2003 I became a SAP Consultant and work with that since (coding in my free time)
- I learn guitar on my time off
